# Day_planner





First I added a Index.html.

- I wrote the header and <p> in Line 14 and 15.
- I added the workday hours with class and id for the style and script sheets.
  
Second the style sheet.

- I added using the classes the style to my page, changing the background for each hour. 
- I also centered the header and <p>. 
- I moved the hours to the left and left space for the work details.
  

Third the Script sheet.

- For each house I added a save button to the write side.
- I then made it functional so even if you reload the page it will be still saved.
- I also added a life time Date under the Header and <p>.
- And since the it has a life time date and time, it will mark the past hours with gray background and the present hour with red and the future hours with green.
